**Onboarding PDF Summary:**

1. **File Purpose:** The purpose of this file is to test the Dashboard view in a Django-based application.

2. **Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**
   - `setUp` method: Creates various entities (user, notification, course, section, assignment) for testing purposes.
   - `add_session_to_request` function: Attaches a session to a request.
   - `test_dashboard_view_context` method: Tests the Dashboard view with context setup and assertion.

3. **Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
   - Inputs: A simulated HttpRequest object.
   - Outputs: A response status code (200) from the Dashboard view.
   - Side effects: The creation of entities for testing purposes.

4. **Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
   - No specific design patterns or dependencies are mentioned in this file.

5. **Cohesion and Coupling:**
   - Cohesion is relatively high as all methods and functions within this class focus on testing the Dashboard view.
   - Coupling is moderate as this class depends on other classes and models (User, Notification, Course, Section, Assignment) for its functionality.
