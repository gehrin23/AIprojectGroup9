**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**Overall File Purpose:**
This file contains a suite of tests for creating courses in the Django-based application. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful course creation, empty fields, duplicate entries, and invalid dates.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. `test_create_course`: Tests the creation of a new course with valid inputs.
2. `test_create_course_success`: Verifies that a course is created successfully when all required fields are provided.
3. `test_create_course_empty_course_id`: Checks what happens when the course ID field is left blank.
4. `test_create_course_empty_course_name`: Tests the behavior when the course name field is empty.
5. `test_create_course_empty_course_credits`: Verifies that no course is created when the credits field is left blank.
6. `test_create_course_duplicate`: Ensures that a duplicate course cannot be created.
7. `test_create_course_early_start_date`: Tests what happens when the start date is earlier than expected.
8. `test_create_course_late_start_date`: Verifies that a late start date does not create a course.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs:
	+ Valid and invalid course ID, name, credits, start date, and end date.
	+ Empty fields for course ID, name, and credits.
* Outputs:
	+ HTTP response codes (200, 400, etc.).
	+ Course object creation or failure.
* Side Effects:
	+ Database updates when a course is created successfully.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* This file uses the Django testing framework to create and manipulate test data.
* It depends on the `User` model from `django_app.models` and the `Course` model.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
This file has moderate cohesion (each test function is focused on a specific scenario) and low coupling (there are no strong dependencies between tests).
