**File Purpose:**

This JavaScript file is responsible for managing and displaying a calendar-based task management system. It allows users to add, delete, and filter tasks, as well as view the tasks associated with each date.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. `renderTasks()`: Renders the tasks table in the HTML document.
2. `addTask(event)`: Adds a new task to the tasks object and updates the tasks table and calendar.
3. `deleteTask(date, taskName)`: Deletes a task from the tasks object and updates the tasks table and calendar.
4. `filterTasks(event)`: Filters the tasks based on date or other criteria and updates the tasks table and calendar.
5. `renderCalendar(year, month)`: Renders the calendar for a given month and year.
6. `createDaySlot(day, type, fullDate = null)`: Creates a day slot element in the calendar.
7. `showPopup(date, taskList)`: Shows a popup with tasks for a date.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: Event objects, form data, and user input (e.g., adding or deleting tasks)
* Outputs: Updated tasks table and calendar
* Side effects: Updates the tasks object and the HTML document

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* The code uses a simple object-oriented approach to manage tasks and their associated dates.
* It relies on JavaScript's built-in `Date` object and DOM manipulation functions.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

* The code exhibits good cohesion as each function or method performs a specific task-related operation.
* However, there is some coupling between the functions (e.g., `addTask()` calls `updateTasksAndCalendar()`), which could be improved by using events or callbacks to decouple them.

* Delete task functionality
* Filter task functionality
* Calendar view of tasks
* Task popup for detailed information

Technical Details:

* JavaScript language used
* DOM manipulation functions used to update the HTML document
* Simple object-oriented approach used to manage tasks and dates

Design Patterns:
