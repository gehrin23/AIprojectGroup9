I'm ready to analyze the source code and its pre-existing documentation! Please provide the code file(s) you'd like me to work with, and I'll get started on writing clearer, comprehensive, intelligent, clean, inline comments and docstrings.

Once I've completed my task, I'll produce an onboarding PDF summary of the entire project, including:

1. Overall file purpose
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects
4. Design patterns, dependencies
5. Point out cohesion and coupling

Please provide the code files, and let's get started!
