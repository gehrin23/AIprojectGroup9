### Onboarding PDF Summary

#### Overall File Purpose
This file contains a test case for the `Calendar` view in a Django application. It ensures that the view correctly handles GET requests and returns an appropriate response.

#### Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities
- **test_calendar_view_get**: This method tests the behavior of the `Calendar` view when it receives a GET request. It checks if the response is an instance of `HttpResponse`, contains basic HTML content, and has a status code of 200.

#### Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects
- **Inputs**: None
- **Outputs**: None
- **Side Effects**: The method asserts certain conditions but does not produce any outputs. If assertions fail, it raises an `AssertionError`.

#### Design Patterns, Dependencies
- **Design Patterns**: This test case follows the unit testing pattern typical in Django projects.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `TestCase` from `django.test`
  - `Calendar` view from `django_app.views`
  - `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` from `django.http`

#### Cohesion and Coupling
- **Cohesion**: The test case is highly cohesive, focusing on testing a specific aspect of the `Calendar` view.
- **Coupling**: The coupling is low as the test case only depends on Django's built-in classes and methods for HTTP requests and responses. It does not have complex dependencies beyond what is necessary for testing the view.
