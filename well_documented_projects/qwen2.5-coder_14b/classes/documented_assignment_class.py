### Onboarding PDF Summary

#### 1. Overall File Purpose
This file contains a class `AssignmentHandler` designed to manage and retrieve assignment data specifically for Teaching Assistants (TAs) within a Django application.

#### 2. Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities
- **`__init__()`**: Initializes the `AssignmentHandler` class with an empty dictionary `ta_assignments` to store assignments for each TA.
- **`get_all_ta_assignments()`**: Fetches all assignments assigned to TAs from the database, stores them in the `ta_assignments` dictionary, and returns this dictionary.

#### 3. Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects
- **Inputs**: None (no direct inputs required, but relies on the database state).
- **Outputs**: Returns a dictionary where keys are User objects representing TAs and values are QuerySets of Assignment objects.
- **Side Effects**: Updates the instance's `ta_assignments` dictionary with the fetched data.

#### 4. Design Patterns, Dependencies
- **Design Pattern**: The class follows a simple Singleton-like pattern in terms of managing state (storing assignments in an instance variable).
- **Dependencies**:
  - Django ORM: Used to interact with the database and query User and Assignment models.
  - `django_app.models.User` and `django_app.models.Assignment`: Models used to fetch data from the database.

#### 5. Point Out Cohesion and Coupling
- **Cohesion**: High cohesion within the class as both methods are focused on handling and retrieving assignment data for TAs.
- **Coupling**: Tight coupling with the Django ORM, which is necessary to interact with the database but can make the class less flexible if changes in the model structure occur.
