I'd be happy to help with that.

**Onboarding PDF Summary:**

**Overall File Purpose:**
This is a dashboard for users with different roles (Admin/Supervisor, Instructor, TA) in the JAAMZ Group Team. The dashboard provides an overview of various aspects, including user profiles, notifications, tasks, courses, and sections.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. **Sidebar Navigation:** Allows users to navigate through different sections of the dashboard.
2. **Profile Section:** Displays user profile information (name, email, role).
3. **Notifications Section:** Shows a list of notifications for the user.
4. **Tasks Section:** Lists tasks assigned to the user, along with course and section details.
5. **Course Overview:** Provides an overview of courses, including instructors and sections.
6. **Section Overview:** Offers an overview of sections, including courses and TAs.
7. **All Users Section:** Displays a list of all users in the system.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* The dashboard receives user input through navigation and profile editing.
* It displays user data, notifications, tasks, courses, and sections as output.
* It does not have any side effects that require special handling.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
The code uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and Django templating to create the dashboard. The templates rely on database queries to retrieve user and course information.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The code demonstrates moderate cohesion, as each section is relatively self-contained. However, there are some dependencies between sections (e.g., courses require instructors). To improve cohesion, consider breaking down larger sections into smaller, more focused components. Coupling is also moderate, as the dashboard relies on multiple templates and database queries.
