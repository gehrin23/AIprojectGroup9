### Onboarding PDF Summary

1. **Overall File Purpose:**
   - The file serves as the entry point for an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) application in a Django project named `django_project`. It configures and exposes the ASGI callable, which is essential for deploying the Django application asynchronously.

2. **Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**
   - `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_project.settings')`: This line sets the default settings module to be used by Django. The settings module contains configuration that controls various aspects of the Django project, such as database settings, middleware configurations, and more.
   - `get_asgi_application()`: This function from Django's core ASGI module returns an ASGI application instance configured with the settings specified in the environment variable.

3. **Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
   - **Inputs:** The file does not take any direct inputs but relies on environment variables and the Django project's settings.
   - **Outputs:** It outputs an ASGI application callable named `application`, which can be used by a server to handle asynchronous requests.
   - **Side Effects:** It sets an environment variable, which affects how Django behaves when importing modules and accessing configuration.

4. **Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
   - **Design Pattern:** The use of the ASGI interface is consistent with the Microservices architecture pattern, allowing for asynchronous request handling.
   - **Dependencies:** 
     - The file depends on the `os` module to interact with environment variables.
     - It also depends on Django's `django.core.asgi` module to get the ASGI application.

5. **Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**
   - **Cohesion:** The file is highly cohesive as it focuses solely on configuring and exposing the ASGI application for a Django project.
   - **Coupling:** The coupling is low as the file interacts with external configurations through environment variables and relies on well-defined interfaces provided by Django. It does not tightly couple itself to any specific implementation details of the Django framework.

This summary provides a clear understanding of the purpose, functionality, and design considerations of the ASGI configuration file in the Django project.
