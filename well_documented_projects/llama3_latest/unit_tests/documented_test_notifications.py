**File Purpose:**
The provided code is a set of tests for the Notifications and Delete Notification views in a Django-based application. These views are responsible for managing notifications sent to users.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `TestNotificationsView`: This test class contains two methods:
	* `test_get_notifications`: Verifies that the `get` method of the `Notifications` view returns a successful response with the expected notifications.
	* `test_post_notifications`: Tests the creation of a new notification using the `post` method of the `Notifications` view.
2. `TestDeleteNotificationView`: This test class contains one method:
	* `test_post_delete_notification`: Verifies that the `post` method of the `DeleteNotification` view deletes the specified notification.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

1. The tests take no input and produce no output other than asserting the expected results.
2. Side effects include creating and deleting notifications in the database.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

1. The code uses Django's built-in testing framework (`django.test`) to write unit tests.
2. It relies on the `Notification` model from the `django_app.models` module and the `Notifications` and `DeleteNotification` views from the `django_app.views` module.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

1. The test classes have high cohesion, as each method focuses on testing a specific view method.
2. The code has moderate coupling, as it relies on external dependencies (models and views) but does not exhibit strong coupling between the tests themselves.

**Additional Notes:**
No additional comments or docstrings are needed for this code.
