Overall file purpose: The `urls.py` file defines the URL patterns for the `django_project` project. It includes various views and routes that are defined in the `views.py` file, including the `LandingPage`, `Login`, `Dashboard`, `CreateUser`, `CreateCourse`, `UpdatePersonnelInformation`, `Logout`, `Calendar`, `Notifications`, `Tasks`, `DisplayAllUsers`, `AssignUser`, `CreateSection`, `EditSection`, `EditCourse`, `ManageCoursesSections`, `ViewTAAssignments`, `DeleteTask`, `Email`.
    1. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
        * `LandingPage`: The landing page view displays the initial dashboard for users when they first visit the website. It includes a list of active courses and sections, as well as any notifications that are due or overdue.
        * `Login`: The login view is responsible for authenticating users and allowing them to access the site's functionality.
        * `Dashboard`: The dashboard view displays user information and allows users to navigate to other views within the site, such as their profile page or a specific course or section.
        * `CreateUser`: The create user view allows administrators to create new users in the system.
        * `CreateCourse`: The create course view allows administrators to create new courses in the system.
        * `UpdatePersonnelInformation`: The update personnel information view allows administrators to update user information, such as contact details or roles.
        * `Logout`: The logout view is responsible for logging users out of the site and ending their session.
        * `Calendar`: The calendar view displays a calendar that shows upcoming events and deadlines for users, as well as any notifications that are due or overdue.
        * `Notifications`: The notifications view displays all notifications that are due or overdue, as well as any messages that users have received from other users.
        * `Tasks`: The tasks view allows users to access their list of tasks and deadlines for the course they are currently enrolled in.
        * `DisplayAllUsers`: The display all users view allows administrators to see a list of all active users in the system, including information about their role and any notifications that they have received.
        * `AssignUser`: The assign user view allows administrators to assign users to specific courses or sections within the system.
        * `CreateSection`: The create section view allows administrators to create new sections within a course in the system.
        * `EditSection`: The edit section view allows administrators to update information about an existing section, such as its name or description.
        * `EditCourse`: The edit course view allows administrators to update information about an existing course, such as its name, description, or any assignments that are due or overdue.
        * `ManageCoursesSections`: The manage courses/sections view allows administrators to manage all courses and sections within the system, including adding new ones or updating existing ones.
        * `ViewTAAssignments`: The view TA assignments view allows teaching assistants to access their list of assignments that are due or overdue for a specific course or section they are responsible for managing.

        * `Email`: The email view allows users to send emails to other users within the system.
2. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
    1. Inputs: User credentials (username, password) for authentication.
    2. Outputs: A dashboard page that displays a list of active courses and sections, as well as any notifications that are due or overdue.
3. Design patterns, dependencies: The `urls.py` file uses the Django framework's built-in URL routing system to define the URL patterns for the project. It also includes various views and templates that are defined in the `views.py` file, which use Python programming language and Django framework.
4. Point out cohesion and coupling:
    1. Cohesion: The functions/methods within each view are well-organized and focused on a specific task or responsibility. For example, the `LandingPage` view has a single function that is responsible for displaying the initial dashboard page for users.
    2. Coupling: The views in this file have a high level of coupling with the underlying Django framework and other components within the system, such as databases, templates, and user credentials. This allows them to perform their specific tasks effectively, but also makes changes or updates more difficult if the dependencies are not properly managed.
