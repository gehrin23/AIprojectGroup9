Based on the provided code, I will summarize the project in a PDF format as per your requirements. Here is the summary:

**Overall File Purpose:**
The purpose of this HTML file is to create an email feature for a learning management system or online course platform.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1. The file contains an HTML template with various navigation links, menus, and forms for creating and sending emails.
2. The `<form>` element in the HTML code handles the submission of new email requests, which includes selecting recipients, entering subject lines, and writing messages.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

1. Inputs:
	* User input through the email form (recipients, subject line, and message).
	* Data from the database (users, roles) to populate the recipient dropdown list.
2. Outputs:
	* The email form submission data is sent to the server-side for processing and sending the email.
3. Side Effects:
	* Temporary display of success or error messages after submitting the form.

**Design Patterns/Dependencies:**
The code uses HTML templates, CSS stylesheets (not shown in this snippet), and JavaScript for client-side validation and effects.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

1. Cohesion: The file has a clear purpose and functionality focused on creating an email feature.
2. Coupling: The file relies on external dependencies like the database (for user data) and CSS files, which can affect its overall maintainability and scalability.

This summary provides an overview of the project's purpose, key functions, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, and cohesion/coupling aspects.
