Overall file purpose
The DeleteUsers class in this file is a Django TestCase that tests the functionality of deleting a user from the database using the DeleteUser method.

Key functions/methods and their responsibilities
The DeleteUsers class contains three methods: setUp, test_delete_user, and tearDown.

* setUp: creates a new User object in the database with specified values for each field.
* test_delete_user: tests whether the user exists in the database after deleting it using the DeleteUser method.
* tearDown: deletes all Users from the database at the end of the test case.

Inputs/outputs/side effects
The input for this TestCase is a User object with specified values for each field, which is created in the setUp method. The output is whether the user exists in the database after deleting it using the DeleteUser method, which is tested in the test_delete_user method. This TestCase also has side effects of creating and deleting Users from the database.

Design patterns, dependencies
This TestCase uses the Django TestCase class as its base class, which provides a testing framework for writing unit tests. The DeleteUser method is dependent on the User model in the django_app.models module to delete a user from the database.

Cohesion and coupling
The cohesion of this TestCase is high because it has a clear purpose and well-defined methods that perform specific tasks related to testing the DeleteUser method. The coupling between this TestCase and other classes in the Django framework, such as the User model, is low because this class does not modify any pre-existing functional code but only adds inline comments and docstrings where necessary.
