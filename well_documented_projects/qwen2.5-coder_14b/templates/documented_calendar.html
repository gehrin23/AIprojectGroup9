### Onboarding PDF Summary

#### 1. Overall File Purpose
The provided HTML file is a template for a Monthly Calendar application. It includes navigation elements, a header displaying the current month, and a grid where the calendar days will be dynamically populated. The page also links to a dashboard and course assignments section.

#### 2. Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities

- **Navigation Elements**: 
  - Buttons for navigating to the previous (`<button id="prev-month">`) and next months (`<button id="next-month">`).
  - Links to the Dashboard and Course Assignments sections.

- **Dynamic Content**:
  - The calendar grid is designed to dynamically display the days of the month. This functionality is likely handled by JavaScript, as indicated by the inclusion of `<script src="{% static 'js/tasks.js' %}"></script>`.

#### 3. Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects

- **Inputs**: 
  - User interactions such as clicking on "Previous" or "Next" buttons to navigate through months.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - The calendar grid dynamically updates to show the days of the selected month.
  
- **Side Effects**:
  - No direct side effects are mentioned, but the script could update the DOM and potentially make AJAX calls to fetch data for the current month.

#### 4. Design Patterns, Dependencies

- **Design Patterns**: 
  - The template follows a simple structure with clear separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for dynamic behavior).
  
- **Dependencies**:
  - The file depends on external static resources:
    - `css/calendar.css` for styling the calendar.
    - `js/tasks.js` for handling dynamic behaviors such as month navigation and displaying tasks.

#### 5. Point Out Cohesion and Coupling

- **Cohesion**:
  - High cohesion within sections, where each part of the HTML (header, navigation, main content) has a clear and distinct role.
  
- **Coupling**:
  - Low coupling between different sections of the HTML. The header, navigation, and calendar grid are independent components that interact minimally with each other.
