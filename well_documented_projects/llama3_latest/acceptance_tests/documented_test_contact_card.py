I'm ready to analyze the source code and improve its documentation.

Please provide the source code file(s) you'd like me to work with, and I'll get started on adding inline comments and docstrings as needed. Afterward, I'll create a comprehensive PDF summary of the project, including its overall purpose, key functions/methods, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, dependencies, cohesion, and coupling.

Let's get started!
