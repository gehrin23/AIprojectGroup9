**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects**

* Side Effects: The styling may affect the layout and appearance of the web application.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies**

* This code uses a combination of CSS selectors, properties, and values to define the styling for different elements.
* It depends on the browser's default styles and may not work correctly in older browsers that do not support certain CSS features.

**Cohesion and Coupling**

* The code has high cohesion as it is focused on defining the styling for specific elements and does not mix concerns.
* The code has low coupling as each element's styling is defined independently without relying heavily on other elements.
