### Onboarding PDF Summary

#### 1. Overall File Purpose
This Python file contains the configuration class for a Django application named `django_app`. It sets up essential configurations such as the default auto field type and provides metadata like the app's name and verbose name.

#### 2. Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities
- **`__init__` method (implied by AppConfig inheritance):**
  - Initializes the configuration settings for the Django app.
  - Sets `default_auto_field`, `name`, and `verbose_name`.

#### 3. Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects
- **Inputs:**
  - None, as this class is a configuration class that defines static settings.

- **Outputs:**
  - Configurations applied to the Django application through inheritance from `AppConfig`.

- **Side Effects:**
  - Registers the app with Django using the specified configurations.

#### 4. Design Patterns, Dependencies
- **Design Pattern:** Singleton pattern (implied by AppConfig)
  - The configuration settings are defined in a single class that is used throughout the Django application.
  
- **Dependencies:**
  - `django.apps.AppConfig`: Base class provided by Django for app configurations.

#### 5. Cohesion and Coupling
- **Cohesion:** High
  - All methods and attributes within the `DjangoAppConfig` class are directly related to configuring the Django application.

- **Coupling:** Low
  - The configuration class is loosely coupled with other parts of the application, focusing solely on defining app settings.
