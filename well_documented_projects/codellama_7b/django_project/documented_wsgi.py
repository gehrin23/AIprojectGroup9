1. Overall file purpose
The WSGI configuration file serves as the entry point for Django applications, allowing them to be deployed on web servers that support the WSGI protocol. It exposes a single function called ``application`` that can be imported and used by other Django components, such as URLs, views, and templates.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities
The main function of the file is to expose the WSGI callable, which can be accessed through the module-level variable ``application``. The ``get_wsgi_application`` function is responsible for retrieving the Django settings module and returning an instance of the WSGI application.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects
The file takes no inputs and returns a single value, which is the WSGI callable that represents the application. The side effect of running this file is to make the Django application available for deployment on a web server that supports the WSGI protocol.
4. Design patterns, dependencies
This file uses the Django framework's built-in functionality to retrieve the settings module and create an instance of the WSGI application. It does not define any custom classes or functions.
5. Point out cohesion and coupling
The file is relatively simple and straightforward, with a single function that serves as the entry point for the Django application. There are no explicit dependencies between different components in this file. However, it relies on the Django framework's built-in functionality to retrieve the settings module and create an instance of the WSGI application. Therefore, it is coupled to the Django framework and its conventions for organizing code.
