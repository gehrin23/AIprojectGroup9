Overall file purpose:
The purpose of this code is to test the creation, editing, and deletion of sections within a course in a Django application. The test cases are designed to cover various scenarios involving section creation, editing, and deletion.

Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:

* `setUp()`: This method creates a new course and sets up three sections with different attributes using the `QueryDict` object. It also defines the `courseId`, `credits`, `courseName`, `startDate`, and `endDate` fields for the course.
* `test_create_section()`: This test case creates a new section based on the first `QueryDict` object defined in `setUp()`. The test checks if the section was created successfully and if its attributes match those specified in the dictionary.
* `test_edit_section()`: This test case edits an existing section with the second `QueryDict` object defined in `setUp()`. The test checks if the section's attributes were updated successfully and if the new values match those specified in the dictionary.
* `test_delete_section()`: This test case deletes a section based on its primary key (PK) value. The test checks if the section was deleted successfully and raises an error if it is not found in the database.

Inputs/outputs/side effects:

* Inputs: The test cases take in `QueryDict` objects as input, which are used to create, edit, and delete sections within a course.
* Outputs: The test cases output the updated section attributes after editing or the deleted section's PK value.
* Side effects: The test cases create, edit, and delete sections within a course and check if their attributes were updated successfully or not.

Design patterns, dependencies:
The code uses Django's built-in `TestCase` class to define and run test cases. It also uses the `QueryDict` object to create and manipulate `Section` objects in the database.

Cohesion and coupling:
The code has a good level of cohesion, as it is well-structured and focused on testing specific aspects of section creation, editing, and deletion. The methods within each test case are clearly defined with specific responsibilities, making the code easy to understand and maintain.

However, the code has some coupling issues. The test cases depend on the `Section` model class, which is a part of the Django application, and can be modified or changed if necessary. Additionally, the test cases may fail if the `QueryDict` object is not properly initialized or if there are any errors in creating, editing, or deleting sections within the course.

To address these issues, it would be beneficial to create a separate module for the section-related tests and define the `Section` model class as a separate entity with its own dependencies and test cases. This would help maintain the code's cohesion and reduce coupling.
