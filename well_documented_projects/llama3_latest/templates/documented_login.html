**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
This HTML file is responsible for rendering a login page, allowing users to authenticate with their credentials. The page includes error messaging and provides an option to return to the landing page.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

* **Login Form**: A form that accepts username and password inputs, which are then submitted to the server for authentication.
* **Error Messaging**: Displays error messages if login attempts fail or other errors occur.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs:
	+ Username
	+ Password
* Outputs:
	+ Login success or failure message
	+ Error messages (if applicable)
* Side Effects:
	+ User is redirected to the landing page upon successful login

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
This file uses HTML and JavaScript for client-side rendering. It also relies on a Python backend server to process login requests.

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**

* The file has good cohesion, as it focuses primarily on rendering a single page (the login page) and handles related functionality.
* The file demonstrates loose coupling with the backend server, as the client-side code only handles form submission and error messaging, leaving the authentication logic to the server.

**Additional Comments:**
Note that the JavaScript code is simply hiding the error messages after 5 seconds; a more robust solution would involve re-rendering the page or updating the message dynamically.
