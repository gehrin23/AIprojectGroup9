Here are the correct comments for each method:

```
def test_bad_username(self):
    """
    Test that an invalid username cannot be used to edit a user.
    """
    # ... (test code)
```

For all the other methods, you can add similar comments. For example:

```
def test_invalid_email(self):
    """
    Test that an invalid email address cannot be used to edit a user.
    """
    # ... (test code)

def test_missing_fields(self):
    """
    Test that missing fields in the form prevent it from being submitted.
    """
    # ... (test code)

# ... and so on for each method
```

Remember to keep your comments concise, clear, and descriptive. They should provide a brief overview of what the test is intended to do, without going into too much detail.
