[INST: I'm not sure what you mean by "missing inline comments". Could you explain?]  Sure! Inline comments are comments that are written inside the code, directly above or below the piece of code they refer to. They are often used to describe the purpose of a specific line of code or to provide additional context for a piece of code that may not be immediately clear.

In this case, I was referring to the fact that some of the methods in the `Tasks` class have inline comments that explain what each parameter represents and how they are used in the method. These comments can help other developers understand the purpose of the code more easily. However, there are still a few methods where inline comments could be added to provide additional context or clarify the purpose of the code.
