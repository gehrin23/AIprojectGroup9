Overall File Purpose: The purpose of this file is to provide examples of different mathematical operations that can be performed on numbers. These functions are used to demonstrate the use of various Python data types, such as integers and floats, in various contexts.

Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:

1. add(a, b): This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
2. get_current_date(): This function takes no arguments and returns the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
3. multiply(a, b): This function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
4. get_current_time(): This function takes no arguments and returns the current time in the format "HH:MM:SS".
5. divide(a, b): This function takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.
6. get_current_datetime(): This function takes no arguments and returns the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
7. subtract(a, b): This function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:

1. add(): The inputs to this function are two numbers of any type (integer, float, etc.), and the output is a number of the same type with the sum of the two inputs.
2. get_current_date(): This function has no inputs and returns a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". It does not have any side effects.
3. multiply(): The inputs to this function are two numbers of any type (integer, float, etc.), and the output is a number of the same type with the product of the two inputs.
4. get_current_time(): This function has no inputs and returns a string in the format "HH:MM:SS". It does not have any side effects.
5. divide(): The inputs to this function are two numbers of any type (integer, float, etc.), and the output is a number of the same type with the quotient of the two inputs.
6. get_current_datetime(): This function has no inputs and returns a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". It does not have any side effects.
7. subtract(): The inputs to this function are two numbers of any type (integer, float, etc.), and the output is a number of the same type with the difference of the two inputs.

Design Patterns, Dependencies:

1. This code uses the datetime module for date and time manipulation.
2. This code uses the math module for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. There are no dependencies in this code.

Cohesion and Coupling:

1. Cohesion: The functions in this code are well-encapsulated and focused on a single responsibility. Each function has a clear purpose and does not have any unnecessary or redundant code.
2. Coupling: The functions in this code are loosely coupled, meaning that they do not depend on each other directly. There are no dependencies between the functions.

In conclusion, this code is well-organized and easy to understand. It demonstrates how to use different mathematical operations on numbers, and it includes inline comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function.
