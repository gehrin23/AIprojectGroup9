Here is the adjusted code with added inline comments and a docstring for the class, as well as an onboarding PDF summary of the project:

**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The `new_email.py` file contains a class `New_Email` that represents an email object. It encapsulates the subject, message, and recipient list.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

* `__init__(post_data, receivingList)`: Initializes the New_Email object with the given post data and recipient list.
* `get_subject()`: Returns the email's subject line.
* `get_message()`: Returns the email's message body.
* `get_recipients()`: Returns a list of recipient emails.
* `checkInfo()`: Checks if the email has all necessary information (subject, message, and recipients). If any information is missing, it updates the status message accordingly.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: post_data (dictionary), receivingList (list)
* Outputs: None
* Side Effects: Updates the `statusMessage` attribute with a status indicating the result of sending the email

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
The class uses a simple data encapsulation pattern to store and retrieve email information. It depends on the `User` model from the `django_app.models` module.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The class has high cohesion as it is designed to work with a specific set of attributes (subject, message, and recipients). The methods are tightly coupled to the attributes and perform operations that are relevant to the email object.
