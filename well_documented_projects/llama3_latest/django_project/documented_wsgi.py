Here is the onboarding PDF summary:

**Project Overview**

* The project sets up a WSGI configuration for the django_project using the provided WSGI config file.
* This file exposes the WSGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities**

* `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_project.settings')`: Sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to 'django_project.settings'.
* `get_wsgi_application()`: Returns an instance of Django's WSGIHandler, which will handle all incoming requests to this server.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects**

* Inputs: None
* Outputs: A WSGI callable that returns an instance of Django's WSGIHandler.
* Side effects: Sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable and sets up the WSGI configuration for the django_project.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies**

* The project uses the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) protocol to handle incoming requests.
* It depends on the Django framework and its built-in WSGI handler.

**Cohesion and Coupling**

* The file has a high degree of cohesion as it performs a single task: setting up the WSGI configuration for the django_project.
* The file has low coupling as it only depends on external libraries and does not have any direct dependencies with other files.
