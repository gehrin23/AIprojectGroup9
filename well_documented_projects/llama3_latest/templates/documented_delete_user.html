I'd be happy to assist you in reviewing the existing code and documentation, and providing a comprehensive onboarding PDF summary of the entire project.

**Overall File Purpose:**
The purpose of this HTML file is to delete a user from a system. The file provides a confirmation prompt before deleting the user, allowing the user to confirm or cancel the deletion.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. `delete_user` (not explicitly defined): This function is called when the "Delete" button is submitted. Its responsibility is to delete the specified user from the system.
2. `/display_all_users` URL (not explicitly defined): This URL is responsible for displaying all users in the system.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

1. Inputs: The `delete_user` function takes a user ID or other identifying information as input.
2. Outputs: The deletion of the specified user from the system.
3. Side Effects: None explicitly documented, but it can be inferred that the deletion may have side effects such as updating user lists or triggering notifications.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

1. The file uses a basic HTML structure and CSS for styling.
2. It relies on Django's template language and URL routing to handle form submissions and page navigation.
3. No specific design patterns are explicitly documented, but the use of templates and forms suggests a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

**Point out cohesion and coupling:**

1. The file appears to be tightly coupled with Django's template language and URL routing, making it difficult to reuse or test independently.
2. The code has low cohesion, as each part of the file serves a specific purpose without strong connections between them.

Here is an onboarding PDF summary based on the provided information:

**Delete User Onboarding**

**Overview:**
This HTML file provides a delete user functionality, prompting users for confirmation before deleting the specified user from the system.

**Key Features:**

* Deletes a user from the system
* Provides a confirmation prompt to ensure user intent
* Uses Django's template language and URL routing

**Getting Started:**

1. Review the `delete_user` function (not explicitly defined) for its responsibility in deleting the specified user.
2. Familiarize yourself with the `/display_all_users` URL (not explicitly defined), which displays all users in the system.
3. Study Django's template language and URL routing to understand how this file interacts with the larger application.

**Tips and Tricks:**

* Be cautious when modifying the `delete_user` function, as it may have unintended side effects on user data.
* Consider improving cohesion by breaking down the file into smaller, more focused sections.
* Review Django's documentation for best practices in template language and URL routing.
