Please provide the source code for me to analyze. I will then adjust the pre-existing comments when necessary, add missing inline comments, add docstrings where needed, and rewrite docstrings or inline comments if they are incomplete, incorrect, or not concise.

Once the comments are adjusted, I will generate an onboarding PDF summary of the entire project, including:

1. Overall file purpose
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects
4. Design patterns, dependencies
5. Point out cohesion and coupling

Please provide the source code for me to begin.
