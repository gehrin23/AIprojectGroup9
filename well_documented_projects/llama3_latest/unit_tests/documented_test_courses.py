**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to test the functionality of the `CreateCourse` class in Django. The class is responsible for creating new courses with specified attributes such as course ID, credits, start date, and end date.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1. `test_course_creation`: Tests the creation of a new course with valid input.
2. `test_course_id_max_length`: Tests the maximum length of the course ID and ensures it does not exceed 8 characters.
3. `test_end_date_before_start_date`: Tests that the end date cannot be before the start date.
4. `test_course_start_date_in_the_future`: Tests that the start date cannot be earlier than the current date.
5. `test_course_str`: Tests the string representation of a course object.
6. `test_invalid_credits_value`: Tests that credits must be a whole number.
7. `test_empty_field`: Tests that empty fields are not accepted.
8. `test_course_already_exists`: Tests that a new course cannot be created if one with the same ID already exists.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: Valid or invalid input data for creating a new course (e.g., course ID, credits, start date, end date).
* Outputs:
	+ `course`: A new course object created by the `CreateCourse` class.
	+ `message`: An error message indicating whether the course creation was successful or not.
* Side Effects: The creation of a new course and potential errors reported through the `message` output.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

The code uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with Django's built-in ORM handling database interactions. The `CreateCourse` class serves as the controller, responsible for validating input data and creating a new course object.

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**
The test cases demonstrate good cohesion within each method, focusing on specific scenarios and validation rules. There is moderate coupling between methods, as they share similar inputs and outputs (e.g., `course` and `message`). However, the code remains relatively decoupled, allowing for easy modification or addition of new test cases without affecting existing functionality.

**Additional Comments:**
The code could benefit from additional documentation comments within the `CreateCourse` class to explain its responsibilities and input validation rules. The test cases also assume a specific database schema and may require adjustments if the schema changes in the future.
