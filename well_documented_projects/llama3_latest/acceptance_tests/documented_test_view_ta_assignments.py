PDF Summary of the Project: Acceptance Test Tasks

**File Purpose**

The purpose of this file is to contain acceptance tests for tasks in a course management system. The tests cover various scenarios, including creating and deleting tasks, as well as adding tasks without sections.

**Key Functions/Methods**

1. `test_view_task_list`: Tests the view for displaying task lists.
2. `test_add_new_task`: Creates a new task with specified details.
3. `test_delete_task`: Deletes an existing task.
4. `test_add_task_without_section`: Adds a task without specifying a section.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects**

* Inputs:
	+ Task creation: task name, description, due date, user ID, course ID, and section ID (optional).
	+ Task deletion: task ID.
* Outputs:
	+ Successful creation or deletion of tasks.
* Side Effects:
	+ Database updates for creating or deleting tasks.

**Design Patterns/Dependencies**

The tests utilize Django's built-in testing framework, including `TestCase` and `Client`. The file also leverages Django models (`User`, `Course`, `Section`, and `Assignment`) to interact with the database.

**Cohesion and Coupling**

The acceptance tests are cohesive in that they focus on specific scenarios related to task management. However, some methods may be coupled due to their reliance on shared setup code (e.g., creating users, courses, sections, and assignments).

**Additional Comments**

* The `setUp` method creates test data for the subsequent tests.
* The `tearDown` method ensures that any created data is properly cleaned up after each test.

This summary should provide a concise overview of the project's purpose, key functions, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, dependencies, and cohesion/coupling.
