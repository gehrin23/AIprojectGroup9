Here is the revised code with added inline comments and docstrings:
```
{# Load static assets #}
{% load static %}

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <header>
        {# Navigation #}
        <nav class="nav-left">
            <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
        </nav>
        <h1>Monthly Calendar</h1>
        <nav class="nav-right">
            <a href="/tasks/">Course Assignments</a>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        {# Navigation for the calendar #}
        <div class="calendar-navigation">
            <button id="prev-month">Previous</button>
            <h2 id="current-month"></h2>
            <button id="next-month">Next</button>
        </div>
        
        {# Calendar grid #}
        <div class="calendar-grid">
            <!-- The grid dynamically populates here -->
        </div>
    </main>
    
    {# Script for the calendar logic #}
    <script src="{% static 'js/tasks.js' %}"></script>

```
Here is the onboarding PDF summary of the project:

1. Overall file purpose: This HTML file contains the monthly calendar for a course assignments. It uses JavaScript to dynamically populate the calendar grid with tasks and other relevant information.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
* `{% static 'js/tasks.js' %}` - Contains the logic for the calendar, including the creation of the task objects and the update of the calendar grid.
* `calendar-navigation` - The navigation section of the HTML file that contains the buttons for navigating to the previous or next month.
* `calendar-grid` - The main calendar area where the tasks are displayed.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
* Input: The JSON data of the course assignments, which is loaded from a static asset using the `{% load static %}` tag.
* Output: The dynamically populated calendar grid with the tasks and other relevant information.
* Side effect: The calendar grid is updated whenever the user navigates to a new month or when the task data changes.
4. Design patterns, dependencies:
* Uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for separating the logic of the calendar from the user interface.
* Depends on the `{% static 'js/tasks.js' %}` script for the core functionality of the calendar.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
* Cohesion: The code is well-organized and modular, with clear separations between the different components of the calendar.
* Coupling: The code is relatively loosely coupled, with minimal dependencies between the different parts of the calendar. This allows for easier maintenance and modification of the code.
