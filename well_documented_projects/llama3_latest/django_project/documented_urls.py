**File Purpose:**
This file defines the URL configuration for a Django project, mapping URLs to views. It includes routes for various pages, such as the landing page, login, dashboard, and more.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `urlpatterns`: A list of URL patterns that route URLs to views.
2. `path()`: A function used to define individual URL patterns.
3. `include()`: A function used to include another URLconf in the current project.
4. Various view functions (e.g., `LandingPage`, `Login`, `Dashboard`, etc.) that handle requests and return responses.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: URLs, path patterns
* Outputs: Views, page renderings
* Side effects: None

**Design Patterns/Dependencies:**

1. Django's URL routing system is used to map URLs to views.
2. The `include()` function is used to include another URLconf in the current project.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The file exhibits high cohesion, as each path pattern is mapped to a specific view function that handles the request. The coupling is relatively low, as there are no direct dependencies between the various views or path patterns.
