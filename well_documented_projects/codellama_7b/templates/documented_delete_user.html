* Overall file purpose: To display a message to the user with a warning before deleting a specific user from the database.
* Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
	+ HTML template: Displays the delete confirmation message to the user.
	+ CSS stylesheet: Applies visual styling to the HTML template.
	+ JavaScript file (not included in this code snippet): Handles the form submission and deletion of the user from the database.
* Inputs/outputs/side effects:
	+ Input: The user's role, full name, and ID.
	+ Output: A delete confirmation message to the user before deleting the user from the database.
	+ Side effect: Deletes the user from the database if the user confirms the deletion.
* Design patterns, dependencies:
	+ HTML template uses a CSS stylesheet to apply visual styling and a JavaScript file to handle form submission.
	+ Python code uses Django's `{% csrf_token %}` syntax to include CSRF protection in the form.
* Cohesion and coupling:
	+ High cohesion within the HTML template due to the clear separation of concerns between the message display and the form submission handling.
	+ Low coupling between the Python code and the HTML template due to the use of Django's `{% csrf_token %}` syntax for CSRF protection. The Python code does not rely on any specific implementation details of the HTML template.
