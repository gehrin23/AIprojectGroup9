    """
    Customized administrator for User model.
    Provides a list display of relevant fields.
    """

    list_display = ('user_name', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'street_address', 'state', 'zip_code', 'role_name', 'date_created')
    # Inline comment added to explain the purpose of the class


class courseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """
    Customized administrator for Course model.
    Provides a list display of relevant fields.
    """

    list_display = ('courseName', 'courseId', 'credits')
    # Inline comment added to explain the purpose of the class

    """
    Customized administrator for Section model.
    Provides a list display of relevant fields.

**Onboarding PDF Summary:**

**File Purpose:** The provided code is used to register custom administrators for models in a Django application. It provides list displays of relevant fields for the User, Course, and Section models.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

* `userAdmin`, `courseAdmin`, and `sectionAdmin` classes are customized administrators that provide list displays of relevant fields.
* Each class is responsible for defining the fields to be displayed in the list display.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: None
* Outputs: List displays of relevant fields for User, Course, and Section models
* Side effects: The custom administrators are registered with the admin site

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* The code uses the Django admin framework to register custom administrators.
* It depends on the `django.contrib.admin` and `django_app.models` modules.

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**

* Cohesion: Each class (`userAdmin`, `courseAdmin`, and `sectionAdmin`) is cohesive as it has a single responsibility (providing list displays) and its methods are related to that responsibility.
* Coupling: The code has low coupling as each class depends only on the Django admin framework and the relevant models.
