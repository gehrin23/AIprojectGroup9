The purpose of the code is to create an email form with a success message when the user submits the form. The code uses HTML and CSS to style the form, while JavaScript is used for the functionality.

Key Functions/Methods:

1. `emailForm()` function - This method creates the form element and appends it to the DOM. It also adds event listeners to handle the form submission and success message display.
2. `handleSubmit()` function - This method is called when the form is submitted, and it uses JavaScript's built-in `fetch()` API to send a POST request to the server. The method also handles the error handling and displays an error message if there is an issue with the submission.
3. `displaySuccessMessage()` function - This method displays a success message on the screen when the form submission is successful.

Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:

1. Input - The user enters their name, email address, and message in the form fields.
2. Output - When the user submits the form successfully, they see a success message displayed on the screen.
3. Side Effect - The server receives the form data and sends an email to the admin with the submitted information.

Design Patterns:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern - This pattern separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model, view, and controller. In this case, the `emailForm()` function creates the form element, while the `handleSubmit()` function handles the form submission. The success message is displayed using a third component, the view.
2. Event delegation pattern - This pattern allows for more efficient event handling by attaching a single event listener to a parent node instead of multiple event listeners to each child node. In this case, the `emailForm()` function attaches an event listener to the form element to handle the submit event.
3. Promises pattern - This pattern allows for asynchronous code to be executed in a sequential manner, making it easier to manage and debug. In this case, the `fetch()` API returns a promise that is resolved when the server responds with a success message or rejected if there is an error. The `handleSubmit()` function uses the promise to handle the form submission and display the success message accordingly.

Cohesion and Coupling:

1. Cohesion - The code in this project has high cohesion because each method has a clear purpose and performs only one specific task. For example, the `handleSubmit()` function handles only the form submission and does not have any other responsibilities.
2. Coupling - The code in this project has low coupling because the methods are independent and do not rely on external libraries or dependencies. Each method can be tested and modified independently without affecting other parts of the codebase.
