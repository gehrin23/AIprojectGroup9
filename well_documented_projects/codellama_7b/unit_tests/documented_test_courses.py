1. Overall file purpose
* The overall purpose of the code is to test various features and functionalities of a Django app, specifically the Course model.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities
* setup_method(): This function is used to set up the testing environment for each test case. It passes the test.
* test_course_creation(): This function tests the creation of a new course object using the Course model. It creates a new course object, checks its attributes, and asserts that the object's ID, name, credits, start date, and end date are correct.
* test_course_id_max_length(): This function tests the maximum length of the course ID field by sending a post request with an invalid ID (10 characters) to the create_course view. It asserts that the response message is "Course ID Cannot Be More Than 8 Characters".
* test_end_date_before_start_date(): This function tests whether the end date cannot be before the start date by sending a post request with an invalid end date (before the start date) to the create_course view. It asserts that the response message is "Start Date Cannot Be After The End Date".
* test_course_start_date_in_the_future(): This function tests whether the start date cannot be in the future by sending a post request with an invalid start date (in the future) to the create_course view. It asserts that the response message is "Start Date Cannot Be Earlier Than The Current Date".
* test_course_str(): This function tests the __str__ method of the Course model by creating a new course object and checking its string representation. It asserts that the object's name is correctly represented as a string.
* test_invalid_credits_value(): This function tests whether the credits field can only accept whole numbers by sending a post request with an invalid credits value (a decimal number) to the create_course view. It asserts that the response message is "Credits Must Be A Whole Number".
* test_empty_field(): This function tests whether all fields are required by sending a post request with an empty field (credits) to the create_course view. It asserts that the response message is "This field is required.".
* test_course_already_exists(): This function tests whether courses cannot be created if they already exist by sending two identical post requests to the create_course view. It asserts that the second request returns False and no course object is created.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects
* The inputs for these test cases are:
	+ Post data (with valid or invalid values for each field)
	+ Existing courses in the database (if any)
* The outputs are:
	+ Course objects (created or not created) with correct attributes
	+ Response messages from the create_course view (correct or incorrect)
* The side effects are:
	+ Creation of a new course object in the database (if valid post data is provided)
	+ Modification of an existing course object in the database (if an identical course is created)
4. Design patterns, dependencies
* This code uses TestCase from Django's test framework to write unit tests for the Course model.
* The create_course view is dependent on the Course model and its attributes.
5. Point out cohesion and coupling
* Cohesion: The methods in this class have low cohesion because they are testing different features of the Course model separately, which makes the code harder to read and maintain.
* Coupling: The methods in this class have high coupling because they are dependent on each other to test the entire course creation process correctly. This makes the code more difficult to change or update if any changes are made to the Course model or its dependencies.
