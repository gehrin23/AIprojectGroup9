**Project Overview**

The project is a web-based notification system that allows users to create, view, and delete notifications. The system provides two main sections: the "Notification List" and the "Add New Notification".

**Key Functions/Methods and Responsibilities**

1. `create_notification()`: This function handles the creation of new notifications. It takes in user input for the message and role, and stores the data in a database.
2. `delete_notification(notification_id)`: This function deletes a specific notification based on its ID.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects**

* Inputs: User input for creating or deleting notifications (message and role).
* Outputs: A list of notifications with their corresponding messages and roles.
* Side effects: The creation or deletion of notifications in the database.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies**

The project uses a template-based design pattern to render HTML templates. It also depends on a database system to store and retrieve notification data.

**Cohesion and Coupling**

The project exhibits high cohesion between its different components, as each component (notification creation, deletion, and display) is self-contained and focused on a specific task. The coupling between these components is moderate, as they all rely on the same database system to store and retrieve data.

This summary will be included in an onboarding PDF file for the project.
