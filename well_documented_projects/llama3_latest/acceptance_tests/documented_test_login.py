**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The `AcceptanceTestLogin` file is a test suite for the login functionality of a Django-based application. It contains tests for successful and unsuccessful login attempts, as well as edge cases such as missing or invalid credentials.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1. `setUp`: Sets up the test environment by creating three user objects with different roles (TA, Instructor, Admin) and clients.
2. `test_ta_login_success`, `test_instructor_login_success`, `test_admin_login_success`: Test successful login attempts for each role using the created users and clients.
3. `test_login_invalid_credentials`: Tests that an invalid username or password returns an error message.
4. `test_login_missing_fields`: Tests that missing fields in the login form return an error message.
5. `test_redirect_url_for_undefined_role`: Tests that a user with an undefined role is redirected to the dashboard.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: User credentials (username and password)
* Outputs:
	+ Successful login attempts redirect to the dashboard
	+ Unsuccessful login attempts return error messages
* Side Effects: Users are created or deleted as part of the test setup and teardown

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
The file uses Django's built-in `Client` class for making HTTP requests and `User` model from the `django_app.models` module. It also utilizes Django's testing framework for writing unit tests.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The file has a high level of cohesion as it focuses on testing a specific aspect (login) of the application. The methods are well-organized, and each test is self-contained. There is no obvious coupling between the methods, and they do not depend on each other's results.
