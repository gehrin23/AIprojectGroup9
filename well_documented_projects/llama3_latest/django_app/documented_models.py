**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The provided code defines a comprehensive database model for managing users, courses, sections, assignments, and notifications. This model is likely used in an educational institution or a learning platform.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. **User:** Represents an individual with unique attributes such as username, password, first name, last name, email address, street address, city, state, zip code, phone number, role, date created, and date updated.
2. **Course:** Defines a course with attributes like course ID, credits, name, start date, end date, and associated sections.
3. **Section:** Represents a section of a course with attributes like section ID, type, meets, location, instructors, and associated courses.
4. **Assignment:** Models an assignment with attributes like title, description, due date, course, section, and completion status.
5. **Notification:** Defines a notification with attributes like message, role, and creation timestamp.
6. **CourseAssignment:** Represents the relationship between a user, course, and section with additional information on the grader's role.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* User inputs: username, password, first name, last name, email address, street address, city, state, zip code, phone number, role
* Outputs: user data, course data, section data, assignment data, notification data
* Side effects:
	+ Data validation and sanitization
	+ Authentication and authorization mechanisms

**Design Patterns/Dependencies:**

* The code employs the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model to represent users and their attributes.
* Django's built-in models and database abstractions are used throughout the code.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

The code demonstrates high cohesion among the different models, with each model focusing on a specific aspect of the educational institution. The relationships between models are well-defined, and the code exhibits low coupling, with minimal dependencies between models.

This comprehensive summary should provide a solid foundation for onboarding new developers or users into this project.
