Based on the provided source code, I will create a comprehensive and concise documentation in the form of an onboarding PDF summary.

**File Purpose**
The file purpose is to display task management for course assignments. It provides an interface for administrators, supervisors, instructors, and TAs to view, manage, and assign tasks to users. The dashboard includes a list of tasks, which can be filtered by due date, status, and section. Users with the necessary permissions can also create new tasks, update existing ones, and delete completed or unnecessary tasks.

**Key Functions/Methods**
1. **task_list**: Displays a table containing a list of tasks, including task title, description, assigned user, course, section, due date, and status.
2. **create_task**: Allows administrators, supervisors, instructors, and TAs to create new tasks by providing input fields for task name, description, due date, assigned user, and optional section.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects**
- Input: User interaction with the dashboard (e.g., creating a new task, updating an existing one, or deleting a completed task)
- Output: A list of tasks, including their details (title, description, assigned user, course, section, due date, and status) or confirmation messages for successful task creation/deletion
- Side effects:
  * Updating the task list upon creating, updating, or deleting a task
  * Displaying error messages if invalid input is provided

**Design Patterns, Dependencies**
The code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive web interface. It relies on templates (e.g., Django's template engine) for rendering dynamic content.

**Cohesion and Coupling**
The file demonstrates good cohesion, as each section of the dashboard (task list and task creation/deletion) is logically separate but still interacts with each other through user input and template rendering. The code exhibits moderate coupling, as some sections depend on global variables (e.g., `tasks`, `users`, `courses`, `sections`) to render content.

**Onboarding PDF Summary**
This summary provides an overview of the task management system's purpose, key functions, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, dependencies, and cohesion/coupling. It serves as a reference guide for new users or developers who need to understand how to use and maintain this application.
