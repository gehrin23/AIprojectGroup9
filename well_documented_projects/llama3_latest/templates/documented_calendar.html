Based on the provided HTML file, I'll create a PDF summary of the project.

**File Purpose:**
The purpose of this HTML file is to display a monthly calendar, allowing users to navigate through months and view tasks or assignments associated with each day.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. **Navigation**: The `prev-month` and `next-month` buttons allow users to switch between previous and next months.
2. **Calendar Display**: The `<div class="calendar-grid">` element dynamically populates the calendar grid, displaying days of the month with associated tasks or assignments.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Input: User interaction (button clicks)
* Output: Calendar display and navigation
* Side effects: The JavaScript file (`tasks.js`) handles task-related functionality, which is not included in this HTML file.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
The project appears to follow a simple HTML structure with minimal dependencies. No specific design patterns are evident from this code snippet.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

* Cohesion: The HTML elements work together to display the calendar and provide navigation.
* Coupling: The JavaScript file (`tasks.js`) is not tightly coupled to this HTML file, as it handles task-related functionality separately.
