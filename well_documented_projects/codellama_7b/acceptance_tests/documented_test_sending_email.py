Overall File Purpose:
The purpose of this file is to test the sending email functionality in the Django app. The tests cover various scenarios, including missing information, successful sending of an email, and failure to send an email due to missing recipients or a missing message body.

Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:

* `setUp`: This method is used to set up the test environment by creating a user object and logging in the user.
* `test_missing_recipients`: This test case checks if an email can be sent when no recipients are provided. The test case expects the response to contain "Failed To Send Email! Missing Recipients".
* `test_missing_subject`: This test case checks if an email can be sent when no subject line is provided. The test case expects the response to contain "Failed To Send Email! Missing Subject Line".
* `test_missing_message_body`: This test case checks if an email can be sent when no message body is provided. The test case expects the response to contain "Failed To Send Email! Missing Message Body".
* `test_sending_successful_email`: This test case checks if an email can be successfully sent with valid recipients and a message body. The test case expects the response to contain "Email Successfully Sent!".

Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:

* Inputs:
	+ `recipientList` (list of recipients' email addresses)
	+ `message` (the email message body)
	+ `subject` (the email subject line)
* Outputs:
	+ The status code of the response
	+ A success or failure message in the response body
* Side Effects:
	+ The creation of a new user object
	+ The login of the user
	+ The sending of an email

Design Patterns, Dependencies:

* This test file uses the Django TestCase class to write and execute tests.
* `from django_app.classes.email_class import New_Email`: This statement imports the New_Email class from the email_class module in the Django app.
* `from django_app.models import User`: This statement imports the User model from the models module in the Django app.

Cohesion and Coupling:
The test cases have a high level of cohesion, as they all test sending emails with different combinations of missing information. However, the coupling between the test cases is low, as each test case only depends on the `setUp` method to set up the test environment.
