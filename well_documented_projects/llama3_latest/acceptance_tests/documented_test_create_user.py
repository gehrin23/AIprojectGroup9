Based on the provided code documentation comments, it appears that these tests are checking for various error scenarios when creating a new user. The tests cover cases such as invalid username, password, confirm password, first name, last name, email address, and phone numbers.

Here is a rewritten version of the comments in a more concise and standardized format:

**Test Bad User Creation**

*   Verifies that the error message includes "First name must be at least 2 characters."

### test_bad_last_name
