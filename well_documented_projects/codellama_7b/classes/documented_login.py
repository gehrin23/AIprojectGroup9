Here is the revised code with added inline comments and docstrings:
```
from django_app.models import User

class LoginHandler:
    """Class for handling user login functionality."""

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.username = request['username']
        self.password = request['password']
        self.role = ''

    def validate_user(self):
        """Validate the user's credentials and return True if valid, False otherwise."""
        try:
            user = User.objects.get(user_name=self.username, password=self.password)
            if user:
                self.role = user.role_name
                return True
            return False
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return False

    def get_redirect_url(self):
        """Get the redirect URL for the user based on their role."""
        role_redirects = {
            "TA": "/dashboard/",
            "Instructor": "/dashboard/",
            "Admin/Supervisor": "/dashboard/",
        }

        return role_redirects.get(self.role, '/dashboard/')
```
Overall file purpose: The overall purpose of this file is to handle user login functionality using the `LoginHandler` class.

Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:

* `__init__`: Initializes the `LoginHandler` instance with the request object. Sets the username, password, and role attributes.
* `validate_user`: Validates the user's credentials and returns True if valid, False otherwise.
* `get_redirect_url`: Gets the redirect URL for the user based on their role.

Inputs/outputs/side effects:

* Inputs: The request object containing the username and password.
* Outputs: A boolean value indicating whether the user is valid or not, and if valid, the user's role.
* Side effects: None.

Design patterns, dependencies: This class uses the `User` model from the `django_app.models` module to validate the user's credentials and retrieve their role. It also uses a dictionary to store the redirect URLs for different roles.

Cohesion and coupling: The `LoginHandler` class has high cohesion as all its methods are focused on handling user login functionality. It has low coupling as it does not have any dependencies other than the `User` model from the `django_app.models` module.
