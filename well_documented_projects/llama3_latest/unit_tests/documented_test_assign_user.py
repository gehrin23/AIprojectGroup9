    File Purpose:
    This file contains tests for user assignment in a course. It creates test data and checks if assignments are created correctly.

    Key Functions/Methods:
    - setUp(): Sets up test data.
    - test_user_assignment(): Tests user assignment for a course.

    Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:
    The inputs to this file are the test data (instructors, teaching assistants, courses, and sections). The outputs are the assignments created during the tests. There are no side effects.

    Design Patterns, Dependencies:
    This code uses Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

    Point out cohesion and coupling:
    The code is well-coupled as it only depends on Django's ORM and the models from the django_app app. It is also cohesive as each method or function has a single responsibility.
