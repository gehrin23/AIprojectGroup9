1. Overall file purpose: The code in this file is a responsive HTML template with a header section, hero section, and footer section. The hero section has an image that spans the entire viewport minus the height of the header and footer, and there is a button for the user to click on.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
	* General Reset: This section sets the margin and padding of all elements to zero, and sets the box-sizing property to border-box to avoid any inconsistencies in sizing.
	* Body Styling: This section styles the body element by setting its background color and font family.
	* Header Section: This section creates a header element that displays flexibly with justify-content and align-items set to center, padding 1rem 2rem, and a background of #ffbd00 and white text. It also includes a logo image element with a max-width of 130px and height auto, object-fit set to contain, and an h1 element with flex-grow set to 1, text-align set to center, font size 1.8rem, and no margin.
	* Nav Section: This section creates a nav element that displays flexibly with gap of 2rem between links. It also includes an anchor tag with color white, text decoration none, font size 1rem, padding 0.5rem 1rem, border radius 4px, and transition background-color set to 0.3s ease.
	* Hero Section: This section creates a landing-main element that displays flexibly with justify-content and align-items set to center, min-height of calc(100vh - 100px), text-align set to center, position relative for overlay positioning, and a hero-image element with a width of 100% height auto, object-fit set to cover, max-height set to calc(100vh - 100px), border radius of 8px, box shadow set to 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2).
	* Hero Overlay: This section creates a hero-overlay element that displays flexibly with position absolute, top 50%, left 50%, transform translate(-50%, -50%), display flex, justify-content center, align-items center.
	* Hero Button: This section creates a hero-button element with background color #e6a700, white text, padding of 1rem 2rem, font size of 1.2rem, border none, border radius of 8px, text decoration none, transition set to background-color 0.3s ease, box shadow set to 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), and a hover effect with transform scaled by 1.05.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
	* Inputs: The user can click on the hero button to navigate to another page.
	* Outputs: The button redirects the user to a new page when clicked.
	* Side effects: The code changes the location of the user and navigates them to another page.
4. Design patterns, dependencies:
	* Responsive design: This section includes media queries for smaller screens that adjust the layout and style to fit those screens better.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
	* Cohesion: The code in this file is well-organized with clear sections that do one thing each, making it easy to understand and maintain.
	* Coupling: The code has high coupling as the responsive design section depends on media queries being set up correctly.
