The provided source code is a Django test case for a Calendar view that uses the `django.test.TestCase` class and the `django_app.views.Calendar` class to render an HTML template. Here's a summary of the file purpose, key functions/methods, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, cohesion, and coupling:

1. Overall file purpose: The purpose of this file is to test the `django_app.views.Calendar` view by verifying that it renders an HTML template correctly.
2. Key functions/methods:
	* The `test_calendar_view_get` method in the `TestCalendarView` class tests the `get` method of the `Calendar` view.
	* The `request` object is created and used to call the `get` method of the `Calendar` view.
	* The `response` object is then checked for HTML content and a status code of 200.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
	* The `TestCalendarView` class takes no input parameters.
	* The `get` method of the `Calendar` view accepts an instance of `HttpRequest`.
	* The `response` object returned by the `get` method is an instance of `HttpResponse`, which contains HTML content and a status code of 200.
4. Design patterns:
	* The `TestCalendarView` class uses the Test-Driven Development (TDD) design pattern to write automated tests for the `Calendar` view.
	* The `get` method of the `Calendar` view uses the Template-View design pattern to render an HTML template.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
	* Cohesion: The `TestCalendarView` class has a high degree of cohesion as it contains only one test case for the `get` method of the `Calendar` view.
	* Coupling: The `TestCalendarView` class has a low degree of coupling as it does not depend on any external libraries or frameworks, and its dependencies are limited to the `django.test` module and the `django_app.views` module.
