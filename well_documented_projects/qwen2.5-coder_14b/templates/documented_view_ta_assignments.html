### Onboarding PDF Summary

1. **Overall File Purpose:**
   - The file is a Django template designed to display the list of assignments assigned to each Teaching Assistant (TA). It renders HTML content dynamically using Django's templating language.

2. **Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**
   - There are no explicit functions or methods in this HTML file, as it is purely a template. However, the primary responsibility is to iterate over a dictionary (`ta_assignments`) where keys are TAs and values are lists of their assignments. It then renders this data into an HTML format.

3. **Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
   - **Input:** A dictionary `ta_assignments` where each key is a TA object and each value is a list of assignment objects.
   - **Output:** An HTML page displaying the names of TAs and their respective assignments, including the title, description, and due date of each assignment.
   - **Side Effects:** None. The template only renders data; it does not perform any operations or side effects.

4. **Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
   - **Design Pattern:** The use of Django's templating language follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, where this file acts as the Template.
   - **Dependencies:** 
     - Django framework for rendering the template with context data.
     - HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the output.

5. **Point Out Cohesion and Coupling:**
   - **Cohesion:** High. The template is highly cohesive, focusing solely on rendering TA assignments in a structured format.
   - **Coupling:** Low. The template has low coupling with other components as it only receives data (context) from the view and does not interact directly with models or other views.

This summary provides an overview of the file's purpose, its key responsibilities, input/output details, design considerations, and structural integrity.
