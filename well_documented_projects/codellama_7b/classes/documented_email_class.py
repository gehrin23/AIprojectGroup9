1. Overall file purpose:
The overall purpose of this file is to define a class called `New_Email` which has methods for sending emails with multiple recipients. The class takes in two arguments during initialization, `post_data` and `receivingList`, which are used to set the subject, message, and recipients of the email. The class also has a method called `checkInfo` that checks if all the required information has been provided before sending an email.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
The key methods in this file are `get_subject`, `get_message`, `get_recipients`, and `checkInfo`. The `get_subject` method returns the subject of the email, the `get_message` method returns the message body of the email, the `get_recipients` method returns a list of recipients for the email, and the `checkInfo` method checks if all the required information has been provided before sending an email.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
The inputs to this file are two arguments during initialization, `post_data` and `receivingList`. The output of this file is a class called `New_Email` that can be used to send emails with multiple recipients. The side effect of this file is that it sends an email with the provided information if all required fields have been filled out correctly.
4. Design patterns, dependencies:
This file uses dependency injection to pass in the required information during initialization. It also uses the `if-else` statement to check if all required information has been provided before sending an email.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
The cohesion of this file is high because it has a clear purpose and each method does one specific task. The coupling of this file is also high because it depends on the `if-else` statement to check if all required information has been provided before sending an email, which makes it tightly coupled to that logic.
