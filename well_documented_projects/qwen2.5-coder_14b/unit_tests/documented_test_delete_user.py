### Onboarding PDF Summary

#### 1. Overall File Purpose
The `DeleteUsers` class in this file contains unit tests to verify that the user deletion functionality within a Django application works correctly. It uses Django's testing framework (`TestCase`) and interacts with the `User` model.

#### 2. Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities
- **setUp(self)**: This method is called before each test method runs. It creates a sample user in the database.
- **test_delete_user(self)**: This method tests the deletion of a user by username. It verifies that the user exists before deletion, calls the `DeleteUser` class to delete the user, and then checks that the user no longer exists in the database.
- **tearDown(self)**: This method is called after each test method runs. It deletes all users from the database to ensure a clean state for subsequent tests.

#### 3. Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects
- **Inputs**: None (though indirectly, it relies on the existence of the `DeleteUser` class and its behavior).
- **Outputs**: The test results indicating whether the user deletion functionality works as expected.
- **Side Effects**: Changes the state of the database by creating and deleting users.

#### 4. Design Patterns, Dependencies
- **Design Pattern**: Unit Testing (using Django's TestCase framework).
- **Dependencies**:
  - `django_app.classes.user_class.DeleteUser`: The class responsible for deleting users.
  - `django_app.models.User`: The user model used to create and retrieve user data.

#### 5. Point Out Cohesion and Coupling
- **Cohesion**: High cohesion, as all methods in the `DeleteUsers` class are related to testing the user deletion functionality.
- **Coupling**: Low coupling, as the test methods depend only on the existence of the `User` model and the `DeleteUser` class. They do not directly interact with external systems or components beyond these dependencies.
