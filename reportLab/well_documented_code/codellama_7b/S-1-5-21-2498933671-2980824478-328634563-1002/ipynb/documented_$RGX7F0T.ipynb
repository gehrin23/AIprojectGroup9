     1. The code is a simple Python script that takes in two user inputs, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of multiplying them together.
2. Inline comments explaining key parts and logic:
```scss
# This is an example of inline commenting in Python.
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two inputs a and b and returns their product.
    
    The code first checks if either input is equal to 0. If it is, then the function returns 0 directly without performing any other calculations.
    
    Next, the function checks if the absolute value of either input is greater than 100. If it is, then the function raises a ValueError exception stating that the inputs are too large to multiply together.
    
    After that, the function simply returns the product of the two inputs.
    """
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    elif abs(a) > 100 or abs(b) > 100:
        raise ValueError("The inputs are too large to multiply together")
    else:
        return a * b
```
3. Function/method/class/interface/enum documentation in proper format (docstring):
```scss
# This is an example of function documentation in Python using docstrings.
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiply two numbers together.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int) - The first number to be multiplied.
    b (int) - The second number to be multiplied.
    
    Returns:
    result (int) - The product of the two inputs.
    
    Side Effects: None.
    """
    # code here
```
4. Import notes about usage, edge cases, side effects, limitations, or any other import documentation:
```scss
# This is an example of function import documentation in Python using docstrings.
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiply two numbers together.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int) - The first number to be multiplied.
    b (int) - The second number to be multiplied.
    
    Returns:
    result (int) - The product of the two inputs.
    
    Side Effects: None.
    
    Import Notes:
        This function raises a ValueError exception if either input is equal to 0, or if the absolute value of either input is greater than 100.
        
        This function does not return any side effects or exceptions.
        The function simply returns the product of the two inputs.
    """
    # code here
```
5. Do not alter any existing functional code.
6. If a comment already exists, read over it, and determine if it accurately portrays what the method/function/variable is or is doing. 
7. If comment is inaccurate, adjust the pre-existing comment so that it properly reflects what is happening
8. A comment can be deemed inaccurate if it being to broad, or using incorrect terminology/jargon. 
9. If a comment is a single line, use the appropriate single line comment function, instead of using a multiline function
10.If a comment is a multiple lines, use the appropriate multiple line comment functionality, instead of using the single line function
11. DON'T PROVIDE UNNECESSARY COMMENTATION! Meaning do not reply to the prompt that is being asked. Focus on providing the necessary comments and that is all
