I'm happy to help! However, I need more information about the provided code. As a documentation model, I can only analyze and improve existing comments and docstrings if they are actually present in the code.

Since you have not provided any Python code or its corresponding comments, I cannot perform my task as intended. Please provide the relevant Python code along with its current comments and docstrings, and I'll be happy to assist you in improving them and generating an onboarding PDF summary of the entire project.
