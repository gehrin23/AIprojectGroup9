3. Side effects:
	* Creates/updates/deletes user profiles in the Django database

**Design Patterns, Dependencies**

1. The file uses a combination of object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming concepts.
2. It relies on the Django framework's built-in models and ORM system for data manipulation.

**Cohesion and Coupling**

1. The classes have moderate cohesion, as they share common responsibilities related to user management.
2. The classes are loosely coupled, with minimal dependencies between them.

**Additional Notes**

* The file includes inline comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and behavior of each function/class.
* It uses the Django `User` model to interact with the database and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
* The file assumes a basic understanding of Python programming and Django framework concepts.
