Based on the provided source code, I will produce an onboarding PDF summary of the entire project. Here's the output:

**Overall File Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to run administrative tasks using Django's command-line utility.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. `main()` - This function runs administrative tasks when executed as a script.
2. `execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)` - This function executes the specified command-line arguments.
3. The try-except block handles errors related to importing Django modules.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: None
* Outputs: Execution of administrative tasks
* Side effects: None

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
This file utilizes the Singleton design pattern through `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_project.settings')`. It also depends on Django's core management module (`django.core.management`) and relies on Python's built-in modules (`os` and `sys`).

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**

* The file has high cohesion as it focuses on a single responsibility (running administrative tasks).
* The coupling is moderate, as the file depends on external libraries (Django) and modules (Python's built-in `os` and `sys`). However, this dependency is necessary for the file's purpose.

Here's the onboarding PDF summary:

**Onboarding Summary:**

Welcome to Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks!

This Python script provides a convenient way to run various administrative tasks using Django. Here's what you need to know to get started:

* Purpose: Run administrative tasks using Django's command-line utility.
* Key Functions:
	+ `main()`: Runs administrative tasks when executed as a script.
	+ `execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)`: Executes the specified command-line arguments.
* Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:
	+ No inputs required
	+ Outputs: Execution of administrative tasks
	+ No side effects
* Design Patterns and Dependencies:
	+ Singleton pattern used for setting environment variables
	+ Depends on Django's core management module (`django.core.management`) and Python's built-in modules (`os` and `sys`)
* Cohesion and Coupling:
	+ High cohesion due to single responsibility (running administrative tasks)
	+ Moderate coupling due to dependencies on external libraries and modules

To get started, simply execute this script as a Python program. The script will automatically detect the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable and run the necessary administrative tasks. If you encounter any issues, refer to the error messages for more information.

Happy onboarding!
