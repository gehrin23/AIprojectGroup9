1. Overall file purpose: The file is the main entry point for Django's administrative tasks, as specified in the docstring.

2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
	* `main`: This function is the entry point for executing administrative tasks. It sets the default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable and attempts to import Django's core management module. If successful, it executes the command-line utility from the execute_from_command_line method with sys.argv as its argument.
	* `execute_from_command_line`: This is a method defined in Django's core management module that takes a list of command-line arguments and uses them to execute various administrative tasks. The docstring for this method provides more detail on the specific tasks it can perform.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
	* Inputs: The main function takes sys.argv as its input, which is typically a list of command-line arguments passed to the Django project.
	* Outputs: The main function's primary output is the execution of administrative tasks defined in execute_from_command_line, which can include output from any relevant management commands executed within that method.
	* Side effects: By definition, there are no side effects when executing administrative tasks, as they typically do not modify external data or resources beyond their own scope.
4. Design patterns, dependencies:
	* Dependency injection: The main function relies on the ability to import Django's core management module and execute commands from it. This provides a degree of dependency injection by allowing the file to work with multiple different versions of Django and its associated management module.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
	* High cohesion: The main function is well-structured and has a clear, focused purpose. It does not have too many responsibilities or dependencies, making it easier to understand and maintain.
	* Low coupling: The main function relies on external modules, such as Django's core management module, rather than other parts of the project itself. This helps to keep the codebase modular and separate, which can make it easier to update and maintain over time.
