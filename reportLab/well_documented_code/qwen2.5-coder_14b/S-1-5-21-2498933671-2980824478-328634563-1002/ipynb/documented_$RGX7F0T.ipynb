### Key Points:
1. **Imports**: The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation (`numpy`, `pandas`) and model training (`train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`).
2. **Function Definition**: The function `load_and_preprocess_data` is defined to load, preprocess, and split the dataset.
3. **Data Loading**: Data is loaded using `pd.read_csv`.
4. **Missing Values Handling**: Missing values are filled with the mean of each column.
5. **Feature and Target Split**: Features (`X`) and target (`y`) are separated based on the column name 'target'.
6. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%).
7. **Return Values**: The function returns the training and testing features and targets.
8. **Example Usage**: The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the function and prints the shapes of the datasets for verification.

### Comments:
- Single line comments are used for brief explanations within the code.
- Multiline comments are not necessary in this case as each section is straightforward and concise.

### Documentation:
- Docstrings are provided for the `load_and_preprocess_data` function, detailing its parameters, return values, and purpose.
