**Summary PDF:**

**Project Overview:**
The project is designed to test the functionality of an edit course view in a Django application. The view handles both GET and POST requests to edit or delete courses.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `test_get_edit_course`: Tests that a GET request to edit a course returns the expected response.
2. `test_post_delete_course`: Tests that a POST request to delete a course raises a `Course.DoesNotExist` exception.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs:
	+ HTTP method (GET or POST)
	+ URL for the request
	+ Data to be sent in the request body (for POST requests)
* Outputs:
	+ Response status code (200 OK or other error codes)
	+ Page contents containing course information
* Side effects:
	+ Deletes a course if the POST request is successful

**Design Patterns/Dependencies:**

1. Dependency on Django's RequestFactory and FallbackStorage for creating request objects.
2. Use of Django's URL reversing to generate URLs.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The test cases have moderate cohesion as they are designed to test specific scenarios, but the tests themselves are tightly coupled to the implementation details of the view function. To improve cohesion, the tests could be rewritten to focus on higher-level concepts rather than specific code implementations.
