Based on the provided HTML code, here is the adjusted documentation in the form of an onboarding PDF summary:

**File Purpose:** The Update Information file provides a user interface for updating personnel information. It allows users to modify their profile details such as password, first name, last name, email, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `update_personnel_info()`: This function handles the submission of the form data and updates the user's information in the database.
2. `csrf_token()`: This function generates a unique token for each form submission to prevent CSRF attacks.
3. `get_current_role()`: This function retrieves the current role of the user, which is used to determine what fields are displayed on the form.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: Form data including password, first name, last name, email, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code.
* Outputs: The updated personnel information is stored in the database.
* Side Effects: None

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

1. This code uses a combination of HTML templates (Jinja2) to render dynamic content and Python functions to handle form submissions and data processing.
2. It relies on the Django framework for handling forms, user authentication, and database interactions.

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:** The file has high cohesion as it only handles personnel information updates and is focused on a single task. However, it may have some coupling issues with other parts of the system that rely on similar functionality or data structures.
