1. Overall file purpose: The ASGI configuration file is used to set the ASGI callable variable named `application` and expose it as a module-level variable.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities: The only function of this file is to set the `application` variable, which is an ASGI callable that exposes the Django application.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects: The input for this file is the `os` module, and the output is the `application` variable. There are no side effects in this file.
4. Design patterns, dependencies: This file uses the `django.core.asgi` module to get an ASGI callable using the `get_asgi_application()` function. It also sets the default Django settings module using the `os.environ.setdefault()` method.
5. Point out cohesion and coupling: The cohesion of this file is high because it only has one purpose, which is to set the `application` variable. The coupling of this file is low because it only depends on two modules (`os` and `django.core.asgi`) that are related to Django.
