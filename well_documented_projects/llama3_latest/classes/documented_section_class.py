Here is a summary of the project in the form of an onboarding PDF:

**Overall File Purpose:**
The file contains a class called `SectionClass` that handles section-related operations. It provides methods for creating, editing, and deleting sections.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1. `createSection`: Creates a new section with the provided data.
2. `editSection`: Edits an existing section with the provided data.
3. `deleteSection`: Deletes an existing section.
4. `wellFormed`: Checks if the section instance is valid based on certain criteria.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: QueryDictionary or a section ID, post_data for editing and creating sections.
* Outputs: A tuple containing a boolean indicating success and a message for creating, editing, and deleting sections.
* Side Effects: Creates, edits, or deletes sections in the database.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* This class uses the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as each method has only one responsibility.
* It depends on the Django framework for database operations and other utilities.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The class exhibits high cohesion as all methods are related to section-related operations. The coupling is moderate, as it relies on the `Course` model and Django's ORM capabilities.
