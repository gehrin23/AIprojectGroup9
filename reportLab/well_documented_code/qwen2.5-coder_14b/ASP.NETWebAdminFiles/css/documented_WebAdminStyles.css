/* General Description: 
This CSS file contains styles for various HTML elements and components used in a web application.
It defines classes, IDs, and pseudo-classes to control the visual appearance of the user interface,
including colors, fonts, borders, padding, and other layout properties. The styles are designed to provide
a consistent look across different pages and ensure that the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

Key Parts and Logic:
1. General Text Styles: Defines font families, sizes, and line heights for various text elements.
2. Button Styles: Includes hover effects for buttons to enhance interactivity.
3. Table and List Styles: Provides consistent styling for tables and lists throughout the application.
4. Tab Styles: Defines the appearance of tabs with different states (selected, deselected, hover).
5. Background and Shadow Effects: Uses gradients and shadows to create depth and visual interest.
6. Positioning and Spacing: Utilizes relative and absolute positioning to control element placement.

Usage Notes:
- Ensure that all class names are unique across the application to avoid conflicts.
- Use consistent naming conventions for better maintainability.
- Test styles in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Update styles as needed to reflect changes in design requirements or user interface improvements.
