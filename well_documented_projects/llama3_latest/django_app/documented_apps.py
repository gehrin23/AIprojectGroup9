**Project Summary (PDF)**

**File Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define a Django application configuration for the "django_app" module.

**Key Functions/Methods and Responsibilities:**

1. `DjangoAppConfig`: This class inherits from Django's `AppConfig` and provides configuration settings for the "django_app" module.
    - Responsible for setting the default auto-field to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`.
    - Defines the application name as `'django_app'`.
    - Sets the verbose name for the application as `'Data Bases'`.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: None
* Outputs: The configuration settings defined in this class.
* Side Effects: None

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
This file uses the dependency injection pattern by inheriting from Django's `AppConfig`. It also depends on the `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` model.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

1. Cohesion: The methods within this class are highly cohesive as they all relate to configuring the "django_app" module.
2. Coupling: The coupling between this class and other components is relatively low, making it a self-contained unit.

**Additional Comments:**
```python
class DjangoAppConfig(AppConfig):
    # Define default auto-field for the application
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    
    # Set the name of the application
    name = 'django_app'
    
    # Set the verbose name for the application
    verbose_name = 'Data Bases'
```
