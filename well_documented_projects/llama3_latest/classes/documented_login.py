**Project Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The `LoginHandler` class is responsible for validating user credentials and redirecting users to their respective dashboards based on their roles.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `validate_user()`: Validates a user's username and password, and returns True if the user exists in the database with matching credentials.
2. `get_redirect_url()`: Returns the URL to which the user should be redirected based on their role.

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate user credentials using Django's ORM
* Determine the user's role based on their username and password
* Redirect users to their respective dashboards

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
* Input: Request object with 'username' and 'password' keys
* Output: A boolean indicating whether the user was found, or a redirect URL
* Side effects: None

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* The `LoginHandler` class uses Django's ORM to interact with the database.
* It depends on the `User` model from the `django_app.models` module.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The `LoginHandler` class has a moderate level of cohesion as it performs distinct tasks (validation and redirection). However, its coupling is relatively high due to its dependence on the `User` model and Django's ORM. This could be mitigated by introducing abstractions or interfaces.

**Additional Comments:**

* The `__init__()` method initializes the handler with the request object, which contains the user's username and password.
* The `validate_user()` method uses a try-except block to handle cases where the user is not found in the database.
* The `get_redirect_url()` method uses a dictionary to map roles to redirect URLs.
