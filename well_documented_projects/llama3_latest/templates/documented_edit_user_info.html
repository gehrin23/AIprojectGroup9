Based on the provided HTML code, I will analyze and summarize its purpose, key functions/methods, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, dependencies, and cohesion/coupling. This summary will be in the form of a PDF document.

**File Purpose:**
The file is an HTML template for editing user information. It provides a form to update various details such as password, first name, last name, email, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code. The file also includes navigation links and a notification message area.

**Key Functions/Methods:**
1. Form submission: The form allows users to submit their updated information.
2. User authentication: The file requires user authentication to access the edit user information page.
3. Data validation: The file uses placeholders, pattern attributes, and length constraints to validate user input data.
4. Notification messaging: The file displays a notification message area that can be used to display messages to users.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
- Inputs:
  - User-provided form data (password, first name, last name, email, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code)
  - Current user's role
  - Current user's username
- Outputs:
  - Updated user information (password, first name, last name, email, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code)
  - Notification messages to the user
- Side Effects:
  - The file updates the user's information in the database.

**Design Patterns:**
1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern: The file uses an MVC approach by separating concerns into model (data), view (presentation), and controller (business logic).

**Dependencies:**
The file depends on the following:
1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for client-side rendering and user interaction.
2. A backend framework or database management system to store and retrieve data.

**Cohesion/Coupling:**
1. Cohesion: The file has a high degree of cohesion as it is focused on providing an edit user information form with various input fields and validation mechanisms.
2. Coupling: The file has medium coupling as it relies on external dependencies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework or database management system.
