Overall File Purpose:
The purpose of this file is to test the functionality of a tasks management system in a Django application. It contains unit tests for the tasks views, covering various scenarios such as creating and deleting tasks.

Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:
- setUp(): This method sets up the test environment by creating test users, courses, sections, and assignments.
- test_get_tasks(): Tests the GET request for task listing and verifies the response status code, template used, and content.
- test_post_create_task(): Tests creating a new task and verifies that the task is created successfully with correct details.
- test_post_create_task_without_section(): Tests creating a task without linking to a section and verifies that the task is created successfully without a section.
- test_post_delete_task(): Tests deleting a task and verifies that the task is deleted successfully.
- test_mark_task_complete(): Tests marking a task as complete and verifies that the task status is updated correctly.

Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:
- setUp():
  - Inputs: None
  - Outputs: Test users, courses, sections, and assignments are created in memory.
  - Side effects: The test environment is set up with sample data for testing.
- test_get_tasks():
  - Input: GET request to the tasks view
  - Output: Response object representing the HTTP response
  - Side effects: None
- test_post_create_task():
  - Input: POST request to create a new task
  - Output: Response object representing the HTTP response
  - Side effects: A new task is created in the database.
- test_post_create_task_without_section():
  - Input: POST request to create a new task without section
  - Output: Response object representing the HTTP response
  - Side effects: A new task is created in the database without linking to a section.
- test_post_delete_task():
  - Input: POST request to delete a task
  - Output: Response object representing the HTTP response
  - Side effects: The task is deleted from the database.
- test_mark_task_complete():
  - Input: POST request to mark a task as complete
  - Output: Response object representing the HTTP response
  - Side effects: The task status is updated in the database.

Design Patterns, Dependencies:
The code uses a simple dependency injection approach by using Django's built-in features for handling requests and responses. It also uses ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

Point out cohesion and coupling:

* Cohesion: Each test method has a clear responsibility and focuses on testing a specific functionality of the tasks view.
* Coupling: The tests are loosely coupled, as each test method only interacts with the tasks view and does not depend on other parts of the application.
