Overall file purpose: The AcceptanceTestTasks class is a Django unittest test case that tests the tasks view. It creates users, courses, sections, and assignments for testing purposes.

    Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:

    setUp(): Creates test users, courses, sections, and assignments. Simulates a logged-in session using the client.session object.

    test_view_task_list(): Tests the tasks view by getting a response from the url, checking that the template used is correct, contains the task name, course name, and user name, and redirects to the login page when not logged in.

    test_add_new_task(): Tests adding a new task by posting data to the tasks url with an action of create, title, description, due date, user, course, and section IDs. Checks that the number of assignments is increased by 1 after creating a new task, that the created task has the correct description, ta, course, and section, and that it redirects to the login page when not logged in.

    test_delete_task(): Tests deleting a task by posting data to the delete_task url with the task ID. Checks that the number of assignments is 0 after deleting a task, that the deleted task does not exist in the database, and that it redirects to the login page when not logged in.

    test_add_task_without_section(): Tests adding a new task without a section by posting data to the tasks url with an action of create, title, description, due date, user, course ID, and no section ID. Checks that the number of assignments is increased by 1 after creating a new task, that the created task has the correct description, ta, course, and section (section is None), and that it redirects to the login page when not logged in.

    tearDown(): Deletes all users, courses, sections, and assignments.
