* `/* Hero Section */`: Styles the hero section, including display, alignment, image positioning, overlay placement, button styling, and responsive design.
* `/* Responsive Design */`: Provides media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens (max-width: 768px).

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs: None
* Outputs: Styles are applied to HTML elements

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

* The file uses CSS preprocessors and selectors to define styles.
* The design is based on a responsive layout with media queries for smaller screens.

**Cohesion:** The file has good cohesion as it focuses on styling different parts of the web application's layout. Each section (general reset, body styling, header, hero) has its own distinct styles.
