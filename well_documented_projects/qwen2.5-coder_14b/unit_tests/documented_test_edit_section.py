# Onboarding PDF Summary:

# Overall file purpose:
# This test case file defines a set of unit tests for the Edit_Section view in a Django application.
# The primary responsibility of this file is to ensure that the edit section functionality works as expected.

# Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
# - setUp(): Sets up initial data before each test method runs. It creates a course and a section.
# - test_get_edit_section(): Tests the GET request handling for the Edit_Section view to load the edit section page.

# Inputs/outputs/side effects:
# - Inputs: None, but it uses setup data created in the setUp method.
# - Outputs: The response status code should be 200 indicating a successful GET request.
# - Side Effects: Creates and deletes database records for Course and Section during the tests.

# Design patterns, dependencies:
# - This test case follows the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern commonly used in unit testing.
# - Dependencies include Django's testing framework, HttpRequest, and message storage system.

# Cohesion and coupling:
# - High cohesion: All methods in the class are related to testing the Edit_Section view.
# - Low coupling: The test case is independent of other parts of the application, focusing solely on the Edit_Section functionality.
