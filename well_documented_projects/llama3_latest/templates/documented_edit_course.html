Based on the provided code, I will analyze the file and generate a summary PDF.

**Overall File Purpose:**
The file is an HTML template for editing a course in an educational management system. It allows users to update course information such as course ID, name, credits, start date, and end date.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1. `edit_course`: A function that handles the form submission for editing a course.
2. `create_user`, `create_course`, `create_section`, `manage_courses_sections`, and `logout`: These are URLs that provide access to various features of the educational management system.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

1. The form takes in user input for updating course information (course ID, name, credits, start date, and end date).
2. The updated course information is submitted to the server for processing.
3. The side effect of this process is that the course information is updated in the system.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

1. This file uses HTML template syntax with Jinja2 ({% ... %}) for templating.
2. It relies on Django's built-in form handling and URL routing mechanisms.

**Point out Cohesion and Coupling:**
The code has a good level of cohesion as it focuses on a single task (editing a course) and does not attempt to perform multiple unrelated tasks. However, the file is heavily dependent on external systems (Django, Jinja2) which could be considered as coupling.
