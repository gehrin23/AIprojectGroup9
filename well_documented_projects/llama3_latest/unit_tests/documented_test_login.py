**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**File Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to test the `LoginHandler` class, ensuring its functionality and correctness in validating user credentials and redirecting users to their respective dashboards.

**Key Functions/Methods:**

1. `setUp`: Creates a test user for testing purposes.
2. `test_validate_user_valid`: Tests the `validate_user` method with valid credentials, verifying that it returns `True` and sets the correct role.
3. `test_validate_user_invalid`: Tests the `validate_user` method with invalid credentials, verifying that it returns `False`.
4. `test_get_redirect_url`: Tests the `get_redirect_url` method by simulating a login scenario and checking if the returned URL matches the expected dashboard path.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

* Inputs:
	+ Request data (username, password)
* Outputs:
	+ Boolean result of user validation
	+ Redirect URL for the dashboard
* Side Effects:
	+ Creates a test user in `setUp`
	+ Deletes all users after each test run

**Design Patterns/Dependencies:**
This file uses Django's testing framework (`django.test`) and models (`User` from `django_app.models`). It also relies on the `LoginHandler` class from `django_app.classes.login`.

**Cohesion/Coupling:**
The tests are well-organized, with each test method focused on a specific scenario. The dependencies are clear, relying on the `LoginHandler` and `User` models for testing purposes.
