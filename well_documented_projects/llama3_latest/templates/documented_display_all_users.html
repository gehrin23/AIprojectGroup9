**Onboarding PDF Summary**

**Overall File Purpose:**
The provided HTML file is responsible for displaying a list of all users in the system, along with their roles and associated actions (view, edit, or delete). The file also includes navigation elements to other relevant pages.

**Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:**

1. **Sidebar Navigation:** This function generates the sidebar navigation menu, including links to different pages based on user role.
2. **User List Rendering:** This function loops through a list of users and renders each user's information (name, role) in a table format.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**
The file takes no explicit inputs but relies on data provided by other components (e.g., `all_users` variable). It outputs an HTML page displaying the user list. The side effects include rendering the sidebar navigation menu and the user list table.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**
The file employs a simple template engine (`{% %}`) to generate the HTML content based on dynamic data. It also uses CSS for styling purposes.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**
The file exhibits moderate cohesion, as it combines related features (user list rendering and sidebar navigation) into a single HTML file. The coupling is relatively low, as the file does not heavily depend on other components or external libraries.
