Overall File Purpose: This project contains a simple login form, with the purpose of demonstrating how to use CSS to style an HTML form and implement basic error handling.

Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities:

* General Reset: A CSS reset is used to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
* Basic alert: This class is used to create a simple alert message with a green background color, indicating success.
* Error messages: These classes are used to create error messages with a red background color, indicating failure.
* Body Styling: This CSS rule sets the basic styling for the body element of the HTML document.
* Login Container: This class is used to style the login container element, which contains all the elements related to the login form.
* Form Group Styling: This class is used to style each form group (email and password fields) separately.
* Login Button: This class is used to style the login button, which triggers the login functionality when clicked.
* Error Message: This class is used to style error messages that are displayed when there are issues with the input data.
* Back to Landing Page Button: This class is used to create a button that takes users back to the landing page.

Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:

* Inputs: The user enters their email and password in the form fields.
* Outputs: If the login credentials are valid, the user will be redirected to the main page after successful authentication. If there are any issues with the input data (e.g., invalid email or password), an error message will be displayed.
* Side Effects: The user's login attempt will trigger a server-side request to authenticate the credentials, which may result in a successful or failed response. If successful, the user will be redirected to the main page; if failed, an error message will be displayed.

Design Patterns and Dependencies:

* CSS Preprocessor: This project uses CSS preprocessors (e.g., Sass) to simplify writing and maintaining CSS code.
* HTML/CSS Framework: This project utilizes a basic CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for styling the form elements and creating a responsive layout.
* JavaScript: This project uses JavaScript to handle the login functionality and display error messages upon failure.

Cohesion and Coupling:

* Cohesion: The cohesion of this project is high because each component (e.g., email, password, login button) has a specific purpose and serves only one function.
* Coupling: The coupling of this project is low because the components are loosely coupled with each other, and there is minimal interdependence between them. Each component can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system.
