1. Overall file purpose: This file contains unit tests for the tasks view in the django_app app. It creates a test client, sets up test users and assignments, and tests various scenarios related to task creation, deletion, and marking as complete.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
	* test_get_tasks(): Tests GET request for task listing. Asserts that the status code is 200, template used is tasks.html, and contains specific text like "Grading Homework 1" and "CS101".
	* test_post_create_task(): Tests POST request to create a new task. Asserts that the status code is 302 (redirect), and checks if a new task has been created with specific fields like description, due date, user, course, and section.
	* test_post_delete_task(): Tests deleting a task. Asserts that the status code is 302 (redirect) and that no tasks exist anymore.
	* test_mark_task_complete(): Tests marking a task as complete. Asserts that the status code is 302 (redirect), and checks if the task has been marked as completed.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects:
	* GET request for tasks listing: Returns an HTTP response with status code 200 and template used as tasks.html, containing text related to specific tasks like "Grading Homework 1".
	* POST request to create a new task: Creates a new task object in the database and returns an HTTP redirect to the tasks page after successful creation.
	* POST request to delete a task: Deletes a task from the database and returns an HTTP redirect to the tasks page after successful deletion.
	* POST request to mark a task as complete: Marks a task as completed in the database and returns an HTTP redirect to the tasks page after successful completion.
4. Design patterns, dependencies:
	* Singleton pattern for creating test clients, setting up test users and assignments, and testing various scenarios related to task creation, deletion, and marking as complete.
	* Dependency on django_app models for creating and checking task objects in the database.
5. Cohesion and coupling:
	* High cohesion due to a single responsibility of each test method that tests specific aspects like GET request, POST request, task creation, deletion, marking as complete, etc.
	* Low coupling due to minimal dependencies on external modules and classes.
