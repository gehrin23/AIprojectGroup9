[Overall File Purpose]
The overall purpose of this file is to define a class named SectionClass that provides methods for creating, editing, and deleting sections in the database. The class constructor takes either a QueryDict or an integer representing the section ID as input and initializes the corresponding attributes. The createSection method creates a new section instance in the database based on the input parameters, while the editSection method updates an existing section with the specified changes. Finally, the deleteSection method deletes a section from the database.

[Key Functions/Methods and Their Responsibilities]

* The __init__ method is responsible for initializing the instance variables of the class. If the input is a QueryDict, it checks that there is a course specified and sets the corresponding attributes. Otherwise, it assumes the input is an integer representing the section ID and tries to retrieve the corresponding section from the database.
* The createSection method creates a new section in the database based on the initialized instance variables. It first calls the wellFormed method to check that the input parameters are valid, and then saves the newly created section object using the save() method.
* The editSection method updates an existing section with the specified changes. It first checks that the input is a QueryDict and that there is a course specified, and then checks that the section ID is unique by calling the checkUniq method. If all these conditions are met, it sets the corresponding attributes of the section object and saves it using the save() method.
* The deleteSection method deletes an existing section from the database. It assumes that the input is a QueryDict and calls the wellFormed method to check that the input parameters are valid. If the conditions are met, it deletes the corresponding section object using the delete() method.

[Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects]

* The inputs for the class constructor can be either a QueryDict or an integer representing the section ID.
* The outputs of the createSection and editSection methods are a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful and a message indicating the outcome of the operation.
* The side effects of the methods include creating, updating, or deleting sections in the database.

[Design Patterns and Dependencies]

* The class constructor uses the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by only initializing instance variables based on the input parameter.
* The createSection method uses the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) by creating a new section object and saving it to the database, without modifying any existing code.
* The editSection method uses the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) by updating an existing section based on the input parameters, without changing its behavior.
* The deleteSection method uses the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) by assuming that the input is a QueryDict and calling the wellFormed method to check that the input parameters are valid, without knowing the specific implementation details of the database.

[Cohesion and Coupling]

* The class has high cohesion since all its methods are related to creating, updating, or deleting sections in the database.
* The class has low coupling since it does not depend on any external libraries or frameworks, and can be easily modified or extended without affecting other parts of the system.
