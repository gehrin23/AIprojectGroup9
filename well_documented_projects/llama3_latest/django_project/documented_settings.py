Onboarding PDF Summary:

**Overall File Purpose:**
The file is a Django project settings configuration, which provides essential parameters for running the project. It covers various aspects such as security, database, password validation, internationalization, static files, and email settings.

**Key Functions/Methods and their Responsibilities:**

1.  **`SECRET_KEY`:** This setting generates a secret key used to secure sensitive data like passwords.
2.  **`DEBUG`:** A flag indicating whether debug mode is enabled or not.
3.  **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`:** A list of authorized hostnames that can be accessed by the application.
4.  **`INSTALLED_APPS`:** A list of installed Django applications, including the project's own app.
5.  **`MIDDLEWARE`:** A list of middleware classes used to process incoming requests and outgoing responses.
6.  **`ROOT_URLCONF`:** The URL configuration file for the project.
7.  **`TEMPLATES`:** A list of template engines and directories used by Django.
8.  **`WSGI_APPLICATION`:** The WSGI application instance for the project.
9.  **`DATABASES`:** The default database settings, including engine, name, and path.
10.  **`AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`:** A list of password validators used to validate user input.

**Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects:**

*   The file takes no direct inputs but relies on environment variables for email settings.
*   It produces a configured Django project with the specified settings.
*   Side effects include enabling debug mode, setting up security measures, and configuring database and email services.

**Design Patterns, Dependencies:**

*   The file uses various design patterns like dependency injection (e.g., middleware) and singleton (e.g., SECRET_KEY).
*   It relies on Django's built-in features for internationalization, static files, and email handling.
*   The project is structured using a modular approach with separate apps and directories.

**Cohesion and Coupling:**

*   The file demonstrates high cohesion as it contains related settings and configuration parameters.
*   Coupling is moderate due to dependencies on Django's built-in features. However, the file is well-structured and easy to maintain.

This summary provides a concise overview of the project settings file, highlighting key functions, responsibilities, inputs/outputs/side effects, design patterns, dependencies, cohesion, and coupling.
