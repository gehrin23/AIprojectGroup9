1. Overall file purpose: The HTML file serves as the frontend for the Create Section functionality, allowing users to input course information and create a new section.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities:
* `create_section()`: This function handles the POST request from the form submission, creating a new section in the database and redirecting the user back to the dashboard.
* `load_courses()`: This function retrieves all courses from the database and makes them available for selection by the user on the frontend.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects: The form inputs are sanitized and validated before being sent to the backend, which creates a new section in the database based on the input values. The user is redirected back to the dashboard after successful submission.
4. Design patterns, dependencies: This HTML file utilizes a template engine to generate the frontend HTML code, which in turn relies on the Django framework for server-side functionality. The frontend JavaScript code manages form submission and input validation.
5. Cohesion and coupling: The cohesion of this file is high due to its focused purpose, while the coupling is moderate as it depends on the Django framework for backend logic.
