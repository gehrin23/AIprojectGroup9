1. Overall file purpose - The file purpose is to display a list of notifications and allow users to add new notifications.
2. Key functions/methods and their responsibilities -

The `main` function handles the overall page layout, including the header, navigation menu, and form section for adding new notifications. It also includes some styling using CSS.

The `notification-section` class is responsible for displaying a list of notifications using an unordered list (UL) element. The `role` class is used to format the notification role as text.

The `form-section` class is responsible for creating a form section that allows users to add new notifications. It includes a label for the notification message, a textarea input field for entering the message, and a select element for choosing the role of the notification. The button type is set to "submit" to allow users to submit the form and create a new notification.
3. Inputs/outputs/side effects -

The inputs are:

* The list of notifications (`notifications`)
* The current user's role (`user_role`)

The outputs are:

* A list of notifications that match the current user's role
* A form for adding new notifications
4. Design patterns, dependencies -

This file uses the Model-View-Template (MVT) design pattern to separate concerns and make the code more maintainable. The Model handles data manipulation and the View handles presentation logic, while the Template is responsible for rendering the final HTML output.

Dependencies:

* `notifications` - A list of notifications that match the current user's role
* `user_role` - The current user's role
5. Point out cohesion and coupling -

Cohesion (Internal):
The overall file purpose is well-defined, and each section has a clear responsibility for handling its respective part of the page layout. Each class or function has a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain and modify.

Coupling (External):
The file depends on some external libraries, such as `django` and `bootstrap`, which provide the necessary functionality for rendering the HTML output. However, these dependencies are well-defined and easy to understand.
